                        Yes. Contractually offers a number of basic templates to help you create great-looking contracts. However most of our customers upload their existing Word-based contracts into a simple online version that's easier to share and track.

                    You can copy and paste text from some PDF contracts into a new template in Contractually. If you can select the text in your PDF, you can usually paste it into a contract template.

                    Once you create your contract in Contractually, you can invite others to view, comment, edit, share and sign - all in a simple, secure and intuitive online interface. When you invite someone into a contract, you can give them certain permissions to review, edit, fill in fields and sign. Instead of creating a contract in a word processor and emailing it to each party, the right way to get contracts signed fast is to create, share, edit and sign them entirely online.

No. You are no longer forced to send an email (or worse, paper) to each party to get their feedback or sign the contract.  Everything is done online.  Invite your parties to the contract, and get notified when they have edited or signed your contract.

No. Contractually works just like any other contract process. Share it with your other parties, ensure all content is acceptable, and then each party can sign online.

Any comments and edits you make before sharing are not visible to other parties. Once the contract has been shared, all edits and comments are visible to each party. You can exchange private messages about the contract with other members of your organization, and these are not visible to other people.

From the menu beside your avatar, select Organization, then select +Member to invite other members of your team. This will send them a secure invitation to sign up and join your organization's account. You will be able to add users up to the maximum allowed for your plan.  For one-off contracts, you can invite people in your company using "Invite" in the application.   It is important that invitees DO NOT forward the link to contracts  to other people.

We know what it's like to have old-school friends and colleagues. Once your contract has been shared, any party can select Paper Options just to the lower right of the contract. Once they print it out, sign it and scan it, and send it back to you, it can be uploaded in PDF format from the same menu.  You can mark the contract as Complete there too.

Fields are blocks of text that you can change for each contract. Let's say you have a Sales Agreement where you know the customer name, address, effective date, price and jurisdiction changes for every contract that's created. Each of these blocks can be created as fields.  Rather than hunting through a document to change the text for each contract, simply fill in a form with all the field data on it. It will be automatically populated into the contract.

Create a template. Click the edit button to edit the template. Highlight to select the text you want to turn into a field.  With it highlighted, select the green "+Field" button just to the right of the template, and enter all the default information for the field (a field name, default text, and a short description).  As soon as you create a contract from this template, every field you've created will be presented for you to enter in one place in the fields wizard.

Contractually's pricing is based on feature sets, on a per user per month basis.  A user is someone who initiates, reviews, views, edits, fills out fields, signs or accesses contracts in Contractually in your organization.  This does not extend to individuals in other parties you are doing the contract with.
