Contractually is much more than an e-signature solution. We automate the entire contract process ... but e-signatures happen to be included as a feature.

                        Yes. Contractually offers a number of basic templates to help you create great-looking contracts. However most of our customers upload their existing Word-based contracts into a simple online version that's easier to share and track.

                        A template is a contract that can be reused over and over again.  Turn your existing contracts into simple web forms. Your collaborators will only have to change those elements that are unique to each contract.

                    You can copy and paste text from some PDF contracts into a new template in Contractually. If you can select the text in your PDF, you can usually paste it into a contract template.

                    Once you create your contract in Contractually, you can invite others to view, comment, edit, share and sign - all in a simple, secure and intuitive online interface. When you invite someone into a contract, you can give them certain permissions to review, edit, fill in fields and sign. Instead of creating a contract in a word processor and emailing it to each party, the right way to get contracts signed fast is to create, share, edit and sign them entirely online.

                    <div class="answer inv">
No. You are no longer forced to send an email (or worse, paper) to each party to get their feedback or sign the contract.  Everything is done online.  Invite your parties to the contract, and get notified when they have edited or signed your contract.

                    </div>
                    <div class="answer inv">
No. Contractually works just like any other contract process. Share it with your other parties, ensure all content is acceptable, and then each party can sign online.

                    <div class="answer inv">
Any comments and edits you make before sharing are not visible to other parties. Once the contract has been shared, all edits and comments are visible to each party. You can exchange private messages about the contract with other members of your organization, and these are not visible to other people.
