                    What are e-signatures? Are they legally binding?

                        Electronic signatures are becoming more common in business transactions. There is legislation in the US, Canada and many other jurisdictions that confirms the validity of e-signatures. There also exists case law dating back to the days of the telegraph that accepts electronic signatures as the legal equivalent of ‘wet ink’ signatures.

In the US, the federal ESign Act and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (adopted by almost all US states, with a few states adopting their own legislation) define an electronic signature as “an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record”. The legislation also provides that contracts and signatures may not be denied legal effect solely because they are in electronic form.

One important point of context when thinking about e-signatures is that, in general, contracts do not require signatures in order to be legally binding. E-signatures, like ‘wet ink’ signatures, simply provide evidence about the parties’ intent to be legally bound, but in general they are not an essential element of a binding contract.

For example, verbal contracts can be binding and email exchanges can create binding contracts. The reason for putting contracts in writing and for signing them is to provide much stronger evidence about what was agreed to, and that the parties did in fact intend to be legally bound.

Interestingly, ‘wet ink’ signatures by themselves do not provide very strong evidence about the identity of the signor. Electronic signatures typically provide at least some evidence about the identity of the signor, because the e-signature is typically tied to an email address, an IP address and potentially other personal data about the signor.

                        Background for the US Electronic Signature Law: The Uniform Electronic Transaction Act (state legislation) and the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Act (known as E-Sign Act) are the two key electronic signature acts in the USA. These documents work in tandem, with the UETA taking precedent over the E-Sign Act on the state level, but with E-sign acting as a wider federal safety net. The purpose of both of these acts is to remove doubt concerning the burgeoning field of electronic contract/signatures. Simply stated, their goal is to say it really is all right to do what is already being done.

Background for the Canadian Electronic Signature Law: Like the US, Canada has both federal and provincial acts legislating the acceptability of E-signatures. Two excellent government papers written on this topic in respect to Canada (written by the Federal Government's Law and Government division) are: The Development of Laws on Electronic Documents and E-Commerce Transactions & Facilitating Electronic Commerce Through the Development of Laws to Recognize Electronic Documents and Transactions.

                        Yes! You can append a digital signature function to any existing MS-Word contract and invite others to sign quickly and easily. Once all parties have signed, a PDF version of the completed contract is automatically emailed to participants. All signed contracts are archived in your Contractually account, for easy access when you need them.

                    An email notification will inform your invitee that a contract is ready to review and sign. If they are not already using Contractually, they will be prompted to create account credentials which will be used as verification for signing purposes. Depending on what permissions you have granted, they will be able to review and/or make changes to the contract prior to signing. Invited parties simply click the 'sign contract' button, which will prompt them to confirm their account credentials. When all invited parties have signed, a confirmation email will automatically be sent to participants with a PDF of the signed contract attached. You can access this signed contract any time through your account.

                        A Party is a person that agrees to the contents of a Contract. They are the people that actually sign the contract. Only Parties are capable of signing a contract in Contractually.

A Reviewer is someone that you want to be able to see the draft contract, but not necessarily the person that will be signing it. They could be a lawyer, a CEO, or another member of your company.

A Team Member is an additional administrator on your Contractually account. If you add a Team Member to your Contractually account, they have read-write access including the ability to sign on your behalf, except that they cannot cancel a contract in progress or file as is.

Standard or higher pricing plans include Team Members. You can invite as many Parties as you need to, and those Parties can add as many Reviewers as they require
