                    Once you create your contract in Contractually, you can invite others to view, comment, edit, share and sign - all in a simple, secure and intuitive online interface. When you invite someone into a contract, you can give them certain permissions to review, edit, fill in fields and sign. Instead of creating a contract in a word processor and emailing it to each party, the right way to get contracts signed fast is to create, share, edit and sign them entirely online.

No. You are no longer forced to send an email (or worse, paper) to each party to get their feedback or sign the contract.  Everything is done online.  Invite your parties to the contract, and get notified when they have edited or signed your contract.

No. Contractually works just like any other contract process. Share it with your other parties, ensure all content is acceptable, and then each party can sign online.

Any comments and edits you make before sharing are not visible to other parties. Once the contract has been shared, all edits and comments are visible to each party. You can exchange private messages about the contract with other members of your organization, and these are not visible to other people.

From the menu beside your avatar, select Organization, then select +Member to invite other members of your team. This will send them a secure invitation to sign up and join your organization's account. You will be able to add users up to the maximum allowed for your plan.  For one-off contracts, you can invite people in your company using "Invite" in the application.   It is important that invitees DO NOT forward the link to contracts  to other people.

We know what it's like to have old-school friends and colleagues. Once your contract has been shared, any party can select Paper Options just to the lower right of the contract. Once they print it out, sign it and scan it, and send it back to you, it can be uploaded in PDF format from the same menu.  You can mark the contract as Complete there too.

Fields are blocks of text that you can change for each contract. Let's say you have a Sales Agreement where you know the customer name, address, effective date, price and jurisdiction changes for every contract that's created. Each of these blocks can be created as fields.  Rather than hunting through a document to change the text for each contract, simply fill in a form with all the field data on it. It will be automatically populated into the contract.

Contractually's pricing is based on feature sets, on a per user per month basis.  A user is someone who initiates, reviews, views, edits, fills out fields, signs or accesses contracts in Contractually in your organization.  This does not extend to individuals in other parties you are doing the contract with.

Importing and setting up your library of templates is an important first step with Contractually, if you don't want to use our online templates. However, based on your Word template formatting prior to import, some clean up may be required.  Click EDIT TEMPLATE and you can fix formatting on your templates including bold, spacing and headings. In a few rare cases, you may need to remove all source formatting prior to import and then reformat once imported.

Your contract can be edited by anyone who has been granted Edit permissions for the contract, and as long as the contract has not been signed by any party.  Find your contract in the Dashboard or Contracts tab, click to access it, and (if you have permissions) click Edit above and to the right of your contract. Make your changes using the text editor that appears. You can Save as Draft at any time to preserve your edits without others seeing them.  To allow others to view your changes, click Save and Share. At that point, everyone with access to the contract will see the changes you've made.

No. We should totally add this! But for the moment, with your contract open in Edit mode, make sure you Save as Draft periodically. Your changes will be saved without publishing them to other parties.  Click Save and Share to lock your changes in and make them visible to all parties.

With a contract open in Edit mode, you can Save as Draft at any time to preserve your edits without others seeing them.  To allow others to view your changes, click Save and Share. At that point, everyone with access to the contract will see the changes you've made.
