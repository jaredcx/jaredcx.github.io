<div class="info"><h1>Tawny Owl</h1><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawny_Owl">Tawny Owl</a>
(Strix aluco) is a stocky, medium-sized owl which is common in woodlands across much of Eurasia.
Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and the upperparts are brown or grey.</p>
<p>The nest is typically in a tree hole, and eggs and young are fiercely defended against predators.
This owl is non-migratory and highly territorial, and many young starve if they cannot find a vacant territory
once parental care ceases.</p><p class="note">Image credit:
