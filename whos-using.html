               “As a startup accelerator, we do a lot of contracts, including Share Purchase and IPR agreements. With each intake program we do more than 40 contracts that all require lightning fast turnaround. This was really painful until we started using Contractually, which speeds up our entire contract process. Contractually enables us to focus on offering the best service to our startups and focus on the things that matter most.”

"I have been using Contractually for about year and a half now and the biggest value to me is the ability to draft an electronic contract to protect my company's interest before I disclose material information to consultants or contractors. The fact that I can do it in five minutes or less is what keeps me coming back. Drafting a contract now takes less time than sending an email, at an annual cost that is fraction of a typical lawyer's hourly rate. This has reduced my legal fees significantly, allowed me a quick turnaround when dealing with remote contractors and made me feel confident that I have covered all my bases. No paper, no couriers, no postage, just efficient execution and a piece of mind."

“Contractually has helped ViaSport streamline the contract process of our granting program, allowing us to save thousands of dollars each year in administration costs. This savings means that more of our dollars can be invested directly into community sport programs helping us achieve our goal of making sport more accessible across British Columbia. Additionally, the team at Contractually and the excellent customer service they provide made the transition from away from paper contracts an easy shift for us and our grant recipients.”
