“Contractually has helped ViaSport streamline the contract process of our granting program, allowing us to save thousands of dollars each year in administration costs. This savings means that more of our dollars can be invested directly into community sport programs helping us achieve our goal of making sport more accessible across British Columbia. Additionally, the team at Contractually and the excellent customer service they provide made the transition from away from paper contracts an easy shift for us and our grant recipients.”
