        <h1>Collaboration</h1>
Contractually helps people work better together, both inside and outside your organization. Why send a contract out when you can invite someone in? Sharing is where it’s at.

            <h2>Spend less time chasing emails</h2>
Spend your time sealing the deal instead of trying to figure out who received what version of the contract, and when. Share contracts digitally, with no need to email, print or open in other software. 

Contractually helps you see the progress of each contract instantly, and receive up-to-the-minute status updates. Invite people to work on the contract online. 

They can be people inside your organization, or outside. You choose. Keep track of who’s been invited, and who’s responded.

            <h2>Work together, better, faster</h2>
Upload your existing contracts to get started quickly. Or use Contractually’s design templates to create clean, clear, easy-to-read documents. 

Not every document goes through the same review. Contractually helps you set permissions for who can create, edit, review and sign contracts. 

Share messages privately with your colleagues when you need to, or message everyone. Share comments on the text, and track the history of changes made to each contract. Contractually’s easy-to-read, easy-to-use layouts make it simple to collaborate.

            <h2>Make things easier for everyone</h2>
Attach any schedules and files to the contract as you’re working on it. The attachments stay with the contract and become part of the signed agreement. 
E-signatures make signing fast and easy, with levels of security and detail that go beyond ink. 

Still want a PDF? No problem. Export completed contracts to PDF and send it to everyone in one click.
