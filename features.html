            <font style="color: #5a5a5a;">Contractually helps people work better together, both inside and outside your organization. Why send a contract out when you can invite someone in? Sharing is where it’s at.</font></br></br></br>

               <font style="font-size: 16px;"> Spend your time sealing the deal instead of trying to figure out who received what version of the contract, and when. Share contracts digitally, with no need to email, print or open in other software. 
                Contractually helps you see the progress of each contract instantly, and receive up-to-the-minute status updates. Invite people to work on the contract online. 
                They can be people inside your organization, or outside. You choose. Keep track of who’s been invited, and who’s responded. </font>

<font style="font-size: 16px;">Upload your existing contracts to get started quickly. Or use Contractually’s design templates to create clean, clear, easy-to-read documents. 
Not every document goes through the same review. Contractually helps you set permissions for who can create, edit, review and sign contracts. 
Share messages privately with your colleagues when you need to, or message everyone. Share comments on the text, and track the history of changes made to each contract. Contractually’s easy-to-read, easy-to-use layouts make it simple to collaborate.

<font style="font-size: 16px;">Attach any schedules and files to the contract as you’re working on it. The attachments stay with the contract and become part of the signed agreement. 
E-signatures make signing fast and easy, with levels of security and detail that go beyond ink.

                <h2>Import existing contracts</h2>
                Your contracts and templates are all stored online in digital form with Contractually. Get started quickly by uploading your existing contracts in MS-Word format, or cut and paste from other sources. Format your contracts so that they look great online and are easy to review, edit and sign.
            </div>            
<div class="inv" id="i2">
<h2>Design templates </h2>
Make the process of creating contracts simpler by creating contract templates that you can use 
over and over again.  Change only the information that's unique, like the names of parties, 
signatories, dates, price and product selection, service offerings and terms.  Set your templates 
up so that any trusted colleague can re­use them, and create contracts in minutes. 
</div>
<div class="inv" id="i3">
<h2>Import data from CRM  </h2>
Generate contracts for review and signing directly from your CRM with one click. The information from your CRM auto-populates the contract template you choose. Auto-email the contract for signature in minutes, and invite team members to join the review and editing collaboration.
</div>
<div class="inv" id="i4">
<h2>Add attachments </h2>
Upload important attachments and schedules to the contracts you share with other parties. 
They're permanently associated and bundled with the contract as it moves through the approval 
process. When your signatories apply their e­signature to the contract, they're signing for all the 
attachments as well.
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i5">
<h2>Secure online storage </h2>
Invite someone to sign with their email address, and get your contract signed with a legal, encrypted electronic signature.  Gain confidence in knowing that the identity of your signers is assured, and the document they signed is permanently recorded. 
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i6">
<h2>Contract permissions</h2>
You maintain control over who can view, edit and sign each of the contracts that you share. Contractually helps you protect confidentiality, so the right parties have access to the right contracts at the right time. 
Manage the workflow
Create a Contractually account with a record of all the people in your organization who create and share contracts. Invite your colleagues who need to manage permissions, create or edit contracts, sign them, or simply review them.  Contractually will keep your colleagues up to date on the latest status of each contract they have access to. 
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i7">
<h2>Audit and track contract status </h2>
Keep track of who's seen the contract, who's edited it and when.  Contractually sends you 
notifications when important events occur, like when invitees have opened the contract, made a 
change or even signed it. Auto­reminders go out when parties haven't taken a requested action, 
to help keep the process on track.  
Compare versions 
Get your whole contracts team on the same page. Easily track contract changes from version to 
version without uploading or emailing Word documents. Contractually provides true cloud 
functionality for your documents with full­featured editing and change tracking.
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i8">
<h2>Keep your contracts secure </h2>
Contractually servers are hosted by one of the most trusted and reliable providers in the industry, 
with 99.99% uptime. Our platform uses 256­bit SSL encryption to store and back up your data 
and contracts securely.
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i9">
<h2>Filter and search </h2>
Find what you’re looking for quickly. Tag your contracts to make them easier to find. Filter 
contracts by party, date, status and tags you create.   Contracts are stored securely in an online 
repository for you and your colleagues to retrieve at any time.
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i10">
<h2>Secure e-signatures </h2>
Invite someone to sign with their email address, and get your contract signed with a legal, encrypted electronic signature.  Gain confidence in knowing that the identity of your signers is assured, and the document they signed is permanently recorded.
