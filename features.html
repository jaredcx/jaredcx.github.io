            <font style="color: #5a5a5a;">Contractually helps people work better together, both inside and outside your organization. Why send a contract out when you can invite someone in? Sharing is where it’s at.</font></br></br></br>

               <font style="font-size: 16px;"> Spend your time sealing the deal instead of trying to figure out who received what version of the contract, and when. Share contracts digitally, with no need to email, print or open in other software. 
                Contractually helps you see the progress of each contract instantly, and receive up-to-the-minute status updates. Invite people to work on the contract online. 
                They can be people inside your organization, or outside. You choose. Keep track of who’s been invited, and who’s responded. </font>

<font style="font-size: 16px;">Upload your existing contracts to get started quickly. Or use Contractually’s design templates to create clean, clear, easy-to-read documents. 
Not every document goes through the same review. Contractually helps you set permissions for who can create, edit, review and sign contracts. 
Share messages privately with your colleagues when you need to, or message everyone. Share comments on the text, and track the history of changes made to each contract. Contractually’s easy-to-read, easy-to-use layouts make it simple to collaborate.

<font style="font-size: 16px;">Attach any schedules and files to the contract as you’re working on it. The attachments stay with the contract and become part of the signed agreement. 
E-signatures make signing fast and easy, with levels of security and detail that go beyond ink. 
Still want a PDF? No problem. Export completed contracts to PDF and send it to everyone in one click.

                <h2>Import existing contracts</h2>
                Your contracts and templates are all stored online in digital form with Contractually. Get started quickly by uploading your existing contracts in MS-Word format, or cut and paste from other sources. Format your contracts so that they look great online and are easy to review, edit and sign.
            </div>            
<div class="inv" id="i2">
<h2>Design templates </h2>
Make the process of creating contracts simpler by creating contract templates that you can use 
over and over again.  Change only the information that's unique, like the names of parties, 
signatories, dates, price and product selection, service offerings and terms.  Set your templates 
up so that any trusted colleague can re­use them, and create contracts in minutes. 
</div>
<div class="inv" id="i3">
<h2>Import data from CRM  </h2>
Generate contracts for review and signing directly from your CRM with one click. The information from your CRM auto-populates the contract template you choose. Auto-email the contract for signature in minutes, and invite team members to join the review and editing collaboration.
</div>
<div class="inv" id="i4">
<h2>Encrypted esignatures</h2>
Contractually’s e-signatures create a tamper-proof fingerprint created when each individual signs the contract.
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i5">
<h2>Secure online storage </h2>
With Contractually, you aren’t emailing documents that can easily be forwarded by other parties - users must have the right link to access the contract, and can also set up a password for added security.  Additionally, when you invite someone into a contract, feel secure in that the other party is only viewing that specific contract.  The rest of your contracts are secure in your password protected repository.
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i6">
<h2>Contract permissions</h2>
You maintain control over who can view, edit and sign each of the contracts that you share. Contractually helps you protect confidentiality, so the right parties have access to the right contracts at the right time. 
Manage the workflow
Create a Contractually account with a record of all the people in your organization who create and share contracts. Invite your colleagues who need to manage permissions, create or edit contracts, sign them, or simply review them.  Contractually will keep your colleagues up to date on the latest status of each contract they have access to. 
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i7">
<h2>Workflow management</h2>
Assign permissions to users and invitees to a contract that allow for simple workflows.  Create workflows by assigning specific view and sign privileges to individuals in the flow.
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i8">
<h2>Editing and change tracking</h2>
All edits and changes are saved and new versions created each time someone makes changes to a contract. With Contractually, we automatically create a history log of each version, who made what changes when, and ensure there is no confusion on version control.
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i9">
<h2>Add schedules and files </h2>
Often contracts have supporting material and appendices that are attachments not part of the main body of the contract.  With Contractually, you can simply click and upload and attach other documents so they are always easy to find and review.
</div>         
<div class="inv" id="i10">
<h2>Secure e-signatures </h2>
Invite someone to sign with their email address, and get your contract signed with a legal, encrypted electronic signature.  Gain confidence in knowing that the identity of your signers is assured, and the document they signed is permanently recorded.             
</div>                     
<div class="inv" id="i20">
<h2>API to connect existing systems</h2>
Our API (Application Programming Interface) allows for integrations to any other system.  This enables many advanced features to be created beyond our already robust feature list.  Flow data into contracts from other systems, create custom workflows, flow contract field data into other systems such as Vendor Management, Supply Chain, Financials or other ERP systems.
        </div>   
<div class="inv" id="i21">
<h2>Version control</h2>
Each time a party to the contract makes a change, we keep track of that change and when a user saves and shares the contract, a new version is created.  Compare version to version to see differences between versions, or do a comparison from the first version to the final version to see the entirety of the changes.
</div>          
<div class="inv" id="i22">
<h2>Status tracking</h2>
Logging in and viewing your contract dashboard enables you to see who is a party to that contract, and what the last action taken on the contract was.  As well, receive notifications throughout the evolution of the contract, keeping you up to date when someone takes an action or makes a change.
</div>  
<div class="inv" id="i23">
<h2>Share and messaging options </h2>
Contractually shares its social roots with popular consumer and business applications that make it easier to collaborate.  With Contractually, instead of emailing or sending documents to others, you share with them, inviting them into a contract.  While the parties are negotiating and editing the contract, all comments and messages within your organization and between parties are captured, forming an important part of the history of that contract.
</div>  
<div class="inv" id="i24">
<h2>Secure online storage</h2>
With Contractually, you aren’t emailing documents that can easily be forwarded by other parties - users must have the right link to access the contract, and can also set up a password for added security.  Additionally, when you invite someone into a contract, feel secure in that the other party is only viewing that specific contract.  The rest of your contracts are secure in your password protected repository.
</div>  
<div class="inv" id="i25">
<h2>Advanced filter and search</h2>
Your contracts - whether open or closed, form your contract repository.  All of your contracts can be searched on using party name, date and status.  As well, tag your contracts with important data such as contract type (e.g. NDA), or geography (United States, Canada), to later search on these filters.
