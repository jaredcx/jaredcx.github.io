         <p> Contractually is so much more than an e-signature solution or a contract file server.  We enable teams of people to collaborate to initiate, edit and negotiate contracts all on-line.  Contractually can virtually eliminate the frustration and wasted time related to chasing down contracts or figuring out what version of a contract is the latest.  Things like version control and history simply happen without any action required by users.  It makes doing contracts delightful.

           Using our data gateway (API, Application Programming Interface) or Salesforce.com connector, 
            data flows easily into and out of contracts to other systems. 
            </p><p>
            In an interconnected world, with today’s cloud­based software and open data standards, 
            integrating new technologies to solve old problems is easier than ever.

            <h2>Spend less time chasing emails</h2>
                Spend your time sealing the deal instead of trying to figure out who received what version of the contract, and when. Share contracts digitally, with no need to email, print or open in other software. 
                Contractually helps you see the progress of each contract instantly, and receive up-to-the-minute status updates. Invite people to work on the contract online. 
                They can be people inside your organization, or outside. You choose. Keep track of who’s been invited, and who’s responded.
